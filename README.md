# Hi there, I am MAZEN!
---
I am a motivated software engineer with experience in improving, testing and updating existing software. Passionate about building robust, scalable software systems.
What I do best is finding the ideal, faster, less-complicated and better solution while solving a problem or developing a feature.  
I write technical articles in my [blog](https://dev.to/mazenr).  
Know more about my experience via my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l0RUnw68cAKslaHk_N_YUvp85FVpf1HP/view?usp=sharing).

I try to build software that do cool stuff!
