# Hi there, I am MAZEN!
---
I am a motivated software engineer with experience in improving, testing and updating existing software. Passionate about building robust, scalable software systems.
What I do best is finding the ideal, faster, less-complicated and better solution while solving a problem or developing a feature.  
I write technical articles in [my blog](https://dev.to/mazenr)
